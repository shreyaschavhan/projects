A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen 
scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), 
but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock");
a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").
If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and 
is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. 

Possible cases - 
if player == rock and computer == paper; computer wins
if player == paper and computer == paper; tie
if player == scissors and computer == paper; player wins

if player == rock and computer == rock; tie

if player == rock and computer == scissors; player wins
if player == paper and computer == scissors; computer wins
if player == scissors and computer == scissors; tie
