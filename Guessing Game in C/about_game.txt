This is a program that generates a random number and asks the player
to guess it. If the player's guess is Higher than the actual number the
program displays "Guess lower!". Similarly if the user's guess is too
low, the program prints "Guess Higher!". When the user guesses the correct
number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive
at the number.

Hint :  Use loops
	Use a random number generator.
